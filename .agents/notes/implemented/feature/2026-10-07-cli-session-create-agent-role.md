# CLI session create --agent-role

## Abstract

`lody session create` could not select a workspace Agent Role, so CLI operators
had to hand-assemble the machine, agent config and run configuration that the
MCP create tools already resolve from a Role id. The command now accepts
`--agent-role <idOrName>` and reuses the exact MCP resolution: the Role row is
authoritative for machine, agent config, run config and Prompt prefix, manual
overrides are ignored with a stderr warning, and id/revision/snapshot freeze as
creation provenance. The shared resolution moved from the MCP server module
into `apps/cli/src/lib/agent-role-create.ts` without behavior changes. A Role
that is missing fails fast with the candidate list; an unavailable machine,
config, model or mode still fails in the existing create validation, matching
MCP semantics.

## Decision and evidence

[Issue #1282](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/issues/1282) asks for a CLI Role
selector with MCP-identical resolution. The [creation contract](../../../../specs/session-orchestration.md#session-creation-configuration)
owns Role precedence; the MCP rules in `apps/cli/src/mcp/AGENTS.md` require
manual Machine/Agent/run-config fields to be removed before resolution when a
Role is present, and `packages/shared/AGENTS.md` freezes Role revision, Prompt,
target and dispatch config at creation.

Three functions the MCP server already had — the workspace catalog read, the
Prompt prefix composition, and the provenance binding onto `CreateOptions` —
moved verbatim into `lib/agent-role-create.ts` (the catalog sync reason string
became `agent-role-catalog-read`). The CLI adds two pure pieces on top: an
id-or-unique-name selector mirroring `selectUniqueAgentConfigByIdOrName`, and
`resolveAgentRoleCreate`/`applyAgentRoleCreateTarget`, which derive the same
`{ ...role.runConfig, inheritSessionDefaults: false }` dispatch config and
composed Prompt as `resolveMcpSessionCreate`, then clear the manual flags so
nothing downstream can observe overridden values. The create action resolves
the Role inside `withWorkspaceManager` before building the dispatch config;
`resolveCreateContext` and capability validation run unchanged, so machine
access, online checks and mode/model validation keep their existing hard-fail
behavior. Work-context flags (`--repo`, `--local-project`, `--branch`,
`--worktree`) and `--parent` are untouched.

Alternatives considered and rejected: importing the MCP internals object from
the command layer (creates a commands→mcp dependency against the established
direction) and duplicating a second CLI-side resolution (violates the
single-contract rule and drifts from MCP). Checking
`resolveAgentRoleAvailability` up front was also rejected: the MCP path checks
catalog existence only, and the existing create validation already fails fast
on offline/inaccessible machines and unadvertised modes/models, so an extra
availability gate would be a second, divergent policy.

## Verification

The new suite `apps/cli/src/lib/agent-role-create.test.ts` covers selector
resolution (id first, unique name, ambiguity and not-found errors with the
candidate list), dispatch config and Prompt derivation, ignored-override
listing, catalog loading through a mocked `LoroDocumentManager`, provenance
binding, and a parity test asserting the CLI resolution equals
`resolveMcpSessionCreate` + `buildMcpCreateOptions` for the same Role fixture.
The MCP suite keeps its original coverage with only the sync-reason string
updated.

After integrating current `main` for [PR #1286](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/pull/1286),
the Role resolver, MCP server and session command suites pass all 149 tests.
Conflict resolution retains the retired Review agent removal and the relocated
CLI reference links, alongside the Role option. The merged command continues
through the current attachment preparation and frozen-input creation path.

Typechecking, lint, boundary checks, formatting and documentation checks pass.
The full check encountered two host-environment failures outside this change:
macOS `/var` versus `/private/var` in the worktree query test, and the injected
Git credential wrapper in the native transport test. Both suites pass (25 tests)
with a canonical temporary directory and the wrapper removed from the test process.

Not verified: an end-to-end `lody session create --agent-role` run against a
live workspace (no commander-level harness exists for this command, matching
the existing unit-test-only coverage of the other create flags).
