# Preserve safe context across Streams sync failures

Status: implemented
Translation: current

[中文](2026-10-10-streams-sync-error-context.zh.md)

## Abstract

`Streams sync failed: internal_error` lost the evidence needed to distinguish a request failure from a local storage or CRDT fault. Investigation of the old published packages reproduced both cases, then upstream changes introduced a safe provenance contract. Lody now consumes Repo 0.21.2 with Streams CRDT 0.16.2 and Client 0.9.0, projects that contract into local diagnostics, and formats failures across caller wrappers and synchronization reports. The projection preserves explicit retryability without logging raw exceptions or provider internals. Synthetic validation establishes propagation, not the cause of the original production incident.

## Original investigation

The original checkout pinned Repo 0.21.1, CRDT 0.16.1 and Client 0.8.0. Ten deterministic checks against those exact npm exports established these boundaries:

1. Client normalized its recognized timeout/protocol exceptions and globally treated TypeError as network failure. Ordinary Error became unknown, retaining a cause at that boundary.
2. CRDT sync caught upload, cursor, bootstrap/catch-up, CRDT and durability exceptions. Ordinary Error became internal_error with retryable false; TypeError became network_error. Conversion dropped ordinary causes and errno. A custom fetch throwing Error could therefore look identical to a local cursor fault.
3. Repo fromStreamsError reduced the failure to `Streams sync failed: <code>`, discarding status, request ID, timeout and provenance. Its coarse internal mapping also covered server_error and initial_sync_timeout; default retryability could overwrite the underlying false.
4. Single-transport Repo sync rethrew that error; total multi-transport failure wrapped it in RepoSyncError.report. Later Lody wrappers could not reconstruct the lost evidence. Wiring the old diagnostics callback alone was insufficient.

A cursor store throwing before fetch reproduced the incident message without any network request. HTTP 503 and initial-sync deadline fixtures reproduced separate information loss. The [serialization fix](2026-09-29-streams-sync-serialization.md) documents another historical local route to internal_error; none of these establishes the original incident's root cause.

## Decision and ownership

Streams now records provenance at the actual fetch, HTTP, deadline, cursor, CRDT and durability boundaries. Repo preserves its original discriminator, validated context, failure family and explicit retryability. Reviewed [Repo PR #144](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-repo/pull/144) was merged at `e99f17b`; [release 0.21.2](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-repo/releases/tag/loro-repo-v0.21.2) passed its official registry installation and 32 public API tests. Streams [CRDT 0.16.2](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-streams/releases/tag/streams-crdt-v0.16.2) depends exactly on [Client 0.9.0](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-streams/releases/tag/streams-client-v0.9.0).

Lody's shared tools explicitly select the documented scalar fields. CLI transport creation sends warn/error events to the existing logger; renderer composition sends them to its console sink. Error formatting in CLI, room waits, workspace runtime and session error descriptions serializes the same projection as JSON, avoiding a second display-field list and description dictionary. Ordinary errors keep existing formatting; routine successful synchronization stays silent. Bounded cause traversal handles wrappers and cycles, while reports retain registered transport identities.

The tools bind to each caller's Repo constructors. A standalone pnpm installation resolves different Repo instances for CLI's SQLite 13 peer and shared/renderer SQLite 12 peer; their error class identities are unequal. Defaulting to shared-package instanceof would silently miss CLI failures. Constructor injection preserves typed recognition without accepting arbitrary objects or guessing from messages.

CLI Streams composition explicitly registers that bound formatter with the generic error utility during module initialization. Importing Repo from the generic utility pulled Flock WASM into standalone process-worker bundles, which have no WASM loader. Keeping the runtime binding at composition avoids that dependency and leaves ordinary worker errors on their existing formatting path.

Safe detail includes code, failure family, retryability, room/transport, source, operation/stage, request operation, timeout phase/budget/elapsed time, HTTP status, constrained request ID and allowlisted errno when supplied. It excludes arbitrary message, stack, cause, body, headers, provider, token, key and URL query. Wrapper messages are not reproduced because they may carry those legacy payloads. Failure kind, source and errno remain observed evidence, never a claim that the device is offline or backend is down.

The catalog/lockfile uses the released versions and removes the obsolete Repo peer exception. Unrelated dependencies remain locked, including Roost's separate transitive Client 0.8.0. Local-only composition and disabled telemetry remain unchanged; the diagnostic helper performs no I/O and does not influence retry policy.

## Ablation and scope reduction

[Lody PR #1395](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/pull/1395) contains no new Spec or added tests. The 11 added cases were removed, the two existing checkpoint suites restored, and their test-only shared Flock dependency removed. Existing mock changes only retain real Repo exports while mocking Repo creation; they add no cases. Disposable experiments are outside the PR, using synthetic fetch and fake timers without real network or sleep.

| Removal | Observation | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Description dictionary, second display-field list, exported collector/type | Nine fault fixtures and real CLI logging/wrapper formatting passed using the shared JSON projection. | Remove; helper shrank from 155 to 97 lines. |
| Caller-bound constructors | Shared cases passed, but CLI lost HTTP context because its Repo error classes differ. | Keep constructor injection. |
| Context field selection | Extra synthetic provider/body/header fields appeared in serialized output. | Keep the whitelist. |
| Report traversal / wrapper traversal | Each removal lost the corresponding registered-transport / wrapped failure. | Keep bounded traversal. |
| CLI formatter registration | Wrappers lost context. Direct Repo imports in the generic utility instead broke standalone worker compilation without a WASM loader. | Keep binding in Streams composition. |

## Verification and limits

- Original old-package investigation: 10 deterministic checks passed.
- Ablation retained nine fault fixtures and a real CLI logging/wrapper fixture only in the disposable clone. Removed-feature failures are recorded above. The final PR adds no tests.
- After reduction, all 74 existing relevant cases passed: CLI checkpoint/manager 21; renderer checkpoint/room/runtime/provider 53.
- Frozen lockfile installation, required formatting, full type checks, type-aware lint (0 errors), i18n and all boundary checks passed. CLI production bundle, published adapter/worker checks and WASM copying passed. The nested worktree was not installed.
- The latest `pnpm check` passed full type/static checks; its broad test phase reproduced Git/simulator failures and native IPC timeouts and was stopped. No complete green full-suite result is claimed.
- Earlier full execution found a Roost timeout and nine Git/simulator fixture failures; all ten reproduced against unchanged source and original dependencies. Native cloudflared IPC execution also timed out on unchanged baseline code; standalone worker compilation passes. Broader earlier suites passed shared 1,380, Electron 214 and Streams RPC 124 (3 existing integration skips); the shared count included nine now-removed cases.
- Documentation checks retain the same 74 links into this worktree's uninitialized ACP submodules; there are no new link errors or protected-content changes.

No production logs, credentials, captured transcripts or incident causes were collected. No desktop/browser or deployed-service validation is claimed.
