# Workspace connection lifetime

Status: implemented
Translation: current

[中文](2026-10-10-workspace-connection-lifetime.zh.md)

## Abstract

Connection startup could fail after creating a Repo and listeners, or close could
destroy Repo while an older Web attach still used it. Startup now begins after
its cleanup path exists and failure uses that path. Close cancels token HTTP,
permanently closes existing Effect reconnect loops, and joins attach and Meta
acquisition before destroying Repo. Ordinary storage and Streams protocols stay
unchanged; this does not enable E2EE.

## Ownership and choice

Base: public main `249661be340af5a20b8d0b7334d2e923fe5b5a99`, including
[#1399](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/pull/1399). Unchanged dependencies: Effect
4.0.2, loro-repo 0.21.2, Streams CRDT 0.16.2, client 0.9.0, Loro 1.16.3 and
Flock WASM 0.4.3.

- RuntimeProvider retires UI callbacks immediately and aborts unpublished startup.
  Its existing shutdown chain waits for cleanup before opening the next runtime.
- Runtime owns token HTTP cancellation and all Web attach generations until they
  settle. Retired providers cannot publish a gateway or RPC client; late Meta
  acquisitions release their own lease. Existing generation checks still allow
  token replacement without waiting for an older noncancelable attach.
- Reconnect loops keep the existing Effect clocks and retry policy. `stop()` pauses;
  `close()` prevents rearming and joins reconciliation and timer fibers. There is
  no second ManagedRuntime or generic task framework.
- Repo alone owns durable local data. Stores and transports retain their existing
  cleanup; final Repo destruction follows the owned connection work.

This extends the [Effect foundation](2026-10-09-effect-v4-migration.md) and
[Streams seam](2026-10-10-workspace-streams-content.md), rather than rewriting the
whole runtime. Noncancelable SDK operations still must settle: there is no new
shutdown deadline and no timeout that destroys a Repo still in use. Held in-memory
sends keep their existing policy; persistence evidence covers committed CRDT edits.

## Evidence and limits

The lifecycle, provider, reconnect and Streams factory suites cover failed local
attachment cleanup, cancelled real token-provider HTTP, late auth/attach/Meta,
repeated close, account replacement and existing rotation/retry behavior. A real
loro-repo and IndexedDBStorageAdaptor over fake-indexeddb reopen an offline local
commit after disposal without an explicit flush or remote acknowledgement.

The [contract](../../../../specs/workspace-runtime-lifecycle.md) is draft. Stream
IDs, storage namespaces, snapshots, cursor code and dependency versions do not
change. No keys, persistent mode fields, cryptography, platform key storage,
deployment or installed cross-platform acceptance are included. Promise workflows
outside this selected connection group remain separate work.

Initial head `f9f93315d0e3a1f179d34bb757321664f088d230` validation: the focused four suites pass 89 tests; the components suite
passes 5042 tests in 556 files. Repository typecheck/lint, boundary guards,
format checks and docs check pass. `pnpm check` stops at sandbox `listen EPERM`
in two unchanged shared IPC suites; those pass outside the sandbox (14 tests).
The remaining packages were checked separately. CLI has 3707 passes and one
Git-helper environment failure; its entire affected file passes all six tests
when only that test process uses system Git without inherited `GIT_EXEC_PATH`.
Electron passes 215 tests, UI 299, and turn-diff-store 31. This is split
validation after environment failures, not a successful uninterrupted `pnpm check`.

Correction in [#1406](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/pull/1406): independent review
found the cloud rejoin timeout released the outer loop while the uncancelable SDK
operation still used Repo. The original real-Repo probe reproduced premature
destruction on that head. Runtime now retains every raw rejoin lifetime, removes
it on either outcome, and joins the remaining set after the loops close. The
10-second timeout, concurrency and retry budget remain unchanged; retirement
prevents starting another sweep batch. This repairs the existing close contract.

The four new real-Repo cases fail on the original implementation and pass with
the fix: late success/rejection, overlapping retry attempts, newest-first
completion, and repeated close. They use controlled transports and virtual time,
not a live server or disk-close simulation. Follow-up validation is scoped to the
four owning suites (93 tests), components typecheck, repository quick/static
checks, formatting and docs; the unchanged full local matrix is not rerun.
Independent finding closure remains with the original reviewer.
