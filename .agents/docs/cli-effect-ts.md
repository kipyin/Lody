# Effect TS in the CLI

How `apps/cli` code uses [Effect](https://effect.website) and how Effect code
meets the Promise code it has not replaced yet. The migration order and the
layer map live in the
[lifecycle migration roadmap](../notes/proposed/architecture/2026-09-27-effect-lifecycle-migration-roadmap.md);
binding rules for already-migrated directories live in their `AGENTS.md`
(for example [the shared process layer](../../packages/shared/src/node/AGENTS.md)).
The catalog pins `effect` and `@effect/vitest` to 4.0.2. The [v4 migration
record](../notes/implemented/architecture/2026-10-09-effect-v4-migration.md)
explains version selection and the preserved lifecycle behavior.

## Version-matched reference

Use the repository [Effect skill](../skills/effect-ts/SKILL.md) before Effect work.
Resolve the dependency from the consuming package, read its `effect/AGENTS.md`
completely, then follow its required links and search `ai-docs`/`src` as needed.
A root `node_modules/effect` path is not guaranteed in this pnpm workspace.
Use the [migration skill](../skills/effect-v3-to-v4/SKILL.md) for an explicit v3
migration. Both retain Lody's locked-version and behavioral acceptance rules.
The [reference decision](../notes/implemented/process/2026-10-11-effect-reference-skills.md)
explains why a tracked Effect subtree is not currently recommended.

## When to use Effect

- New modules and services: a `Context.Service` for the capability, a `Layer` for
  each implementation, `Effect.provide` at the composition point.
- Errors: `Data.TaggedError` values and `Effect.catchTag`, not `try`/`catch`
  on unknown exceptions.
- Resources with a lifetime: `Effect.acquireRelease`, `Scope`, `RcMap`.
- Concurrency: fibers, `Semaphore`, `Deferred`, `FiberMap`/`FiberSet`, not
  promise chains, `Map`s of in-flight promises, or `AbortController`s.
- Retries, polling and deadlines: `Schedule`, `Effect.timeout*`, `Effect.sleep`,
  not `setTimeout`/`setInterval` loops.

Raw `async`/`await` remains fine for thin glue at process entry points,
synchronous code without error handling, and hot paths where a measurement shows
Effect overhead matters (the per-token ACP update path, CRDT import/export).

## Rules at the Promise boundary

- Never call `Effect.run*` inside an Effect. Run programs only at an entry point
  or in a temporary facade (below).
- Wrap promises that can reject with `Effect.tryPromise({ try: (signal) => ...,
catch })` and pass the signal on, so interruption aborts the work.
  `Effect.promise` turns a rejection into a defect.
- Surface failures to Promise callers as the typed error itself: run with
  `Effect.runPromiseExit` and throw `Cause.squash(exit.cause)`, not the
  `FiberFailure` wrapper `Effect.runPromise` rejects with. For programs owning
  processes, use `squashProcessFailure`: plain `Cause.squash` can discard a
  simultaneous release defect and its recovery lease.
- An interrupt is owned by a scope or awaited. `void Effect.runPromise(Fiber.interrupt(f))`
  returns before the fiber's finalizers run.
- Put a timeout on the waiter, not on uninterruptible work:
  `Fiber.await(raw).pipe(Effect.timeoutOrElse(...))`. `Effect.timeout` around an
  uninterruptible region waits for that region to finish anyway.
- Bound every wait inside a finalizer. Finalizers are uninterruptible, so an
  unbounded wait there can hang shutdown.
- `FiberMap.run` with an existing key interrupts the old fiber without waiting
  for its finalizers; interrupt and await it yourself when the two must not
  overlap.
- A second `Scope.close` returns without waiting for the first close's
  finalizers; share one memoized close when several callers can end a scope.
- Subscribe to Node events in the same synchronous step as the call that
  produces them (inside an `Effect.callback` register function, or a synchronous
  `onSpawned` hook). A listener attached after a fiber yield can miss an event
  that already fired.

## Process service and resource ownership

Use `ChildProcess` and `ChildProcessSpawner` from `effect/process`. The shared
`ProcessSpawnerLive` implements the official service with Lody's bounded tree
policy and official Node Stream/Sink adapters. `processLayer` composes it with
`NodeProcess`; the CLI's `platformLayer` also supplies its logger. `runCommand`
requires the official spawner, and `spawnProcess` requires Scope. See the
[backend decision](../notes/implemented/architecture/2026-10-09-effect-official-process-service.md)
for why the default Node spawner is not used unchanged.

If bounded Scope termination fails, its Exit contains a `ProcessReleaseFailed`
defect with a recovery lease for the unresolved tree. The owner retains that
lease, observes `isAlive` and retries `retryTermination` before declaring the tree
gone. Scope closure itself is already finished and cannot perform that retry.
`squashProcessFailure` preserves all these leases when an unmigrated Promise
boundary also has a body error. This tree recovery does not certify drained stdio
or complete Session shutdown. See the
[release decision](../notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-10-10-effect-process-release-failure.md).

In pinned 4.0.2, `Effect.mapError` selects a typed failure and can discard other
reasons in a mixed Cause. Resource-owning error conversions use `catchCause` and
`failCause(Cause.map(...))` to retain defects and interruptions. In particular,
failed process acquisition can already have closed its child Scope: its release
lease must reach the caller alongside the setup failure.

Never wrap the shared Promise functions back into an Effect. A runner creates a
separate root fiber. For an unmigrated entry point, the shared facade accepts an
explicit AbortSignal; pass it when the entry point supports cancellation. This
neither supplies structured Effect ownership nor automatically makes its parent
wait for cleanup. Native Effect callers yield the service directly.

A Session owns a container Scope. Each spawn uses a child Scope: failed or
interrupted setup closes it before returning; successful setup retains it until
whole-group exit and drained stdio. Closing the container Scope terminates its trees and stops its
monitor fibers, then removes cgroup resources. `startProcessLegacy` is reserved for
legacy synchronous/raw Node handles (including IPC and explicit detach), whose
owner must await `terminate`; it is not a scoped Effect API.

## Local-project Git

`LocalProjects` / `LocalProjectsLive` own native repository observation and branch
workflows. Their dependencies are `LocalProjectPaths` (official FileSystem),
`LocalProjectHost` (an Effect reading each command's environment), and the official
process spawner. `localProjectLayer` only composes Layers. Existing CLI command,
control, session and worktree-observation entrypoints execute this same kernel
through the one deprecated `localProjectsLegacy` facade. Keep that name visible;
new Effect callers yield native methods. Remove the facade when those application
owners provide LocalProjects. Its synchronous identity methods remain blocking.
Expected Git absence remains a domain result; process, deadline, corruption,
filesystem and release failures propagate. This does not complete worktree
setup/GC or the daemon's root runtime. Decision and limits:
[local-project Git](../notes/implemented/architecture/2026-10-10-effect-local-project-git.md).

## File locks

`withFileLock(name, body, options)` requires `FileLocks`. `FileLocksLive` captures
official FileSystem, native NodeProcess and FileLockHost dependencies. The host
fixes pid and resolves the default lock directory on each operation; tests may
inject a fixed directory.
`fileLockLayer` supplies Node implementations at composition. One service instance
owns local Ref/Deferred admission and unresolved releases; each operation owns its
candidate and acquired file. See the [decision and preserved lock policy](../notes/implemented/architecture/2026-10-10-effect-file-lock-lifecycle.md).

Catalog mutations compose the native API and require FileLocks. Existing Promise
application entrypoints execute them through `fileLocksLegacy.runPromise`; worktree,
cloudflared and Baguette use its `withLock` callback adapter. This one deprecated
facade shares a process-lifetime ManagedRuntime so local queue waiting retains its
old deadline meaning. Remove it when those entrypoints use the daemon runtime.
Catalog read caching, worktree setup/GC and downloads are still under migration.
Local-project Git is native as described above; full worktree ownership is separate.
## Worktree Git execution

`WorktreeGit` / `WorktreeGitLive` own native command execution, status checking and
bounded credential-helper protocol. Layers provide official FileSystem, the process
spawner and a per-command environment Effect. Each command owns its process Scope;
the service has no background work. `worktreeGitLayer` only composes dependencies.
The Promise manager uses the one deprecated `worktreeGitLegacy` facade; remove it
when the manager composes this service. That facade uses the shared complete-Cause
projection. Transport, cancellation and unresolved releases escape manager fallback
catches. Preserve mixed Fail/Die Cause when mapping commands on pinned v4; ordinary
mapError can select only the Fail reason. This is not native manager/setup/GC or
daemon runtime completion. Decision:
[worktree Git](../notes/implemented/architecture/2026-10-10-effect-worktree-git-execution.md).

## Worktree observations

`WorktreeObservations` composes official FileSystem, WorktreeGit and the owning
FileLocks instance. Inspection/listing acquire the repo lease; information reads
inside mutations reuse their caller's lock. Failed Git observations do not become
phantom dirty records or null HEAD. Queued cancellation and command cleanup remain
structured inside this kernel. The Promise manager's `runObservationLegacy` composes through `runWorktreeLegacy`,
which executes in the existing `fileLocksLegacy` runtime, with no second lock coordinator.
Delete it when the mutation owner receives native services. Synchronous manager
path/existence methods, setup, GC and the daemon runtime still need migration. See
[the decision](../notes/implemented/architecture/2026-10-10-effect-worktree-observations.md).

## Temporary Promise facades

A migrated layer is consumed by callers that are still Promise-based. Such a
caller reaches the new service through a facade: the process layer's own
facades at the end of `packages/shared/src/node/process.ts`, which the CLI
uses directly with options composed by `apps/cli/src/platform/process-options.ts`.
They provide the service Layers and apply the failure rule above. A facade is temporary:
it is deleted when its caller migrates, and it never appears inside an already
migrated layer. Current facades:

`pnpm check:cli-process-boundary` fails when code in those packages bypasses
these and reaches `child_process`, `cross-spawn`, `node-pty`, `process.kill` or
a child's `kill` directly.

Session credential acquisition also has a temporary `acquireSessionCredentialsLegacy`
facade (`session/session-credentials.ts`): the Effect broker lease's scope follows
preparation into the live Session and closes on failure/termination. The separate
`makePreparationControlLegacy` facade owns only the preparation TTL and its awaited
close receipt. Claim stops that control without closing runtime resources. These
are bounded resource migrations; Session/ACP/worktree Promise orchestration has
not become Effect-native merely by using these facades.

Execution facades carry a `Legacy` suffix and `@deprecated`; keep that suffix
visible in imports and calls. New Effect workflows compose core APIs and leave
execution to their owning application entry point. Layer builders and pure error
conversions retain their names because they do not execute a program. Current
shared execution facades are:

- `runCommandTextLegacy` and `runCommandTextSyncLegacy`: text output for Promise
  and blocking callers, respectively.
- `startProcessLegacy`: raw Node handle with manual ownership
  (`ProcessHandleLegacy`).
- `terminateChildTreeLegacy` and `signalChildTreeNowLegacy`: awaited tree cleanup
  and synchronous exit-hook signalling, respectively.
- `isPidAliveSyncLegacy` and `probePidSyncLegacy`: synchronous process probes.
- `makeProcessRunnerLegacy` (`ProcessRunnerLegacy`) and `runPromiseSquashedLegacy`:
  temporary execution and error conversion for Promise entry points.

`runCommand`, `runCommandOk`, their Effect-returning Sync variants, `spawnProcess`,
`terminateTree`, `childProcessTree`, `isPidAlive` and `probePid` retain their names.
The guard rejects retired facade imports/exports and aliases that hide Legacy.

## Testing

- Use `@effect/vitest` (`it.effect`, `it.live`) with `TestClock` from
  `effect/testing`. `it.effect` supplies a Scope and test services; v4 has no
  separate `it.scoped`. Use `TestClock.adjust` to drive time. Fork the program, adjust the clock, then
  join or await the fiber.
- Replace services with test Layers or `Effect.provideService`, and assert the
  resulting state (which processes are alive, what was written), not how often a
  mock was called. `@lody/shared/node/process-testing` models the OS process
  table for the process layer.
- `vi.useFakeTimers()` with default options also fakes the timers Effect's
  clock uses. It drives Effect sleeps only when the test advances timers
  (`vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync`); prefer `TestClock` for Effect-first code.

## v4 API choices

- Define capabilities with `Context.Service<Self, Api>()(id)`. `Layer.effect`
  builds both ordinary and scoped implementations; acquisition can require Scope.
- Use `Effect.forkChild` for child-owned work, `Effect.forkIn` for an explicit
  Scope, and `Effect.forkDetach` only when ownership is managed explicitly. The
  taskkill deadline uses the last form and always interrupts and awaits it.
- Use `Scope.provide(program, scope)` when an existing scope owns a program.
  Context-based runners are `Effect.runForkWith(services)`, not a v3 Runtime.
- `Effect.result` returns `Result` (`Success.success` / `Failure.failure`);
  `Effect.catch` handles typed errors. Timeout errors use the tag `TimeoutError`.
- `Cause` contains a flat `reasons` array. Use `findErrorOption`,
  `hasInterrupts` or `hasInterruptsOnly` according to the intended check.
- `Schedule.min([exponential, spaced])` caps a backoff; `Schedule.while` receives
  schedule metadata, whose `input` is the failure being retried.
- `Effect.yieldNow` is an Effect value, not a function. Use `Effect.sleep` and
  `Duration.Input` / `Duration.fromInputUnsafe` for delays.
- ScopedCache operations are module functions. In 4.0.2 bulk disposal joins
  finalizer Exits without propagating their failures; owners that promise to
  report cleanup failures must collect them explicitly.

Use the pinned package's declarations to verify details: the upstream guide can
advance beyond the installed release.


## Local worktree preparation

`LocalWorktreePreparation` composes official FileSystem, WorktreeGit and Clock under
an already-held mutation lease. It owns the metadata scratch directory before
writing and publishes only a complete file. Failed five-second cleanup retains a
bounded recovery Effect. The manager's `runWorktreeLegacy` preserves primary and
scratch release failures through the existing fileLocksLegacy runtime. Delete the
executor when native mutations receive services; bare clone/fetch, setup and GC
remain outside this finite unit. See the [decision](../notes/implemented/architecture/2026-10-10-effect-local-worktree-preparation.md).
