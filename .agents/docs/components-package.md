# `@lody/components`: why the shared-UI rules read the way they do

Scope: `packages/components`. The binding rules live in
[that package's AGENTS.md](../../packages/components/AGENTS.md) and its child scopes;
this page keeps the reasoning that would otherwise crowd them out.

Workspace durable synchronization is composed by `providers/workspace-streams-transport.ts`.
Its [content boundary](../../specs/workspace-streams-content.md) keeps ordinary SDK bytes
and persistence intact while exposing protection and snapshot handling to future callers.
The protected seam is not a product E2EE entry point or a persisted-mode resolver.

## Crash surfaces

Recovery and diagnostic contracts, including callers outside `lib/`, are owned by
[the helper rules](../../packages/components/src/lib/AGENTS.md#crash-recovery-and-diagnostics).

A crash the user cannot read or copy is a crash we never hear about, which is why the
`ErrorBoundary` fallback shows the real error text and offers a one-click copy of the
full report on every build rather than only in development.

Crash screens wait for explicit user recovery; `resetKeys` cannot clear an error.
Authenticated cloud queries retry opaque server failures before reaching a boundary,
with a shared, finite budget. Pending retries return loading rather than stale access
rows. Structured application failures and exhausted retries still throw; the runtime
provider has its own page boundary because it sits above the Outlet boundary. See the
[query adapter](../../packages/components/src/hooks/README.md#cloud-query-recovery).

Both cache-recovery levels defer their asynchronous deletes to the next boot because
`deleteDatabase()` blocks while the runtime still holds a connection; synchronous
storage is cleared first so the boot flag is never written over a half-cleared state.
The localStorage sweep is an explicit DELETE list rather than a keep-allowlist so that
the failure mode of forgetting a key is a surviving cache entry, not a wiped user
preference.

The report carries the tail of `lib/session-render-trace.ts` because a React #185
(nested update limit) report names the fiber where the limit tripped, not the loop that
drove it. The trace is diagnostics only, and its surface mount/unmount lines are written
from a layout effect because passive effects may never flush inside a crashing cascade.

`maybeClearLodyCacheOnBoot` is shared by `AppInitializer` and `RuntimeProvider` so a
user wedged before any workspace still gets the wipe, and so the repo IndexedDB is never
opened before the pending clear has run.

`stuck-connection-banner.tsx` is observational because a slow first sync is not a
failure: the banner offers the cache-clear flow after 45s of continuous `loading` while
the connection attempt completes exactly as it would without it.

## File preview versus Code Collab

File routing, cache, and caller contracts live in
[the helper rules](../../packages/components/src/lib/AGENTS.md#file-preview-and-code-collab).
[File identity background](components-file-paths.md) explains path provenance,
cache aliases, and the existing inspection gaps.

Opening a file to look at it is not a collaboration session. File Preview v3 answers with
a plain read — no workspace watch, no All Changes recompute, no Flock publish — which is
why the file index is only a hint there: a path the index has never seen (an
agent-produced temporary file, say) is still worth sending to the machine, and "too large
to preview" is mostly a remote verdict rather than a fact about a file on this machine,
since the local IPC path reads to `FILE_PREVIEW_V3_LOCAL_LIMITS` derived from the 16 MiB
local response cap.

Preview reads a wider path set than `save-text` writes, which stay inside the session
workspace. Without forcing `external: true` results readonly the editor would show a Save
button for a file the machine will refuse, and the user would lose the edit at save time.

## Theming and fields

Reusable visual primitives and semantic design tokens are owned by
[`@lody/ui`](../../packages/ui/README.md). `@lody/components` composes those
primitives into product surfaces and may add layout or interaction constraints,
while the primitive's props remain the owner of its visual variant, size, tone,
and shape.

For appearance-only migrations, keep each product component's visual rules in a
module-level `stylex.create` definition and name styles by their semantic role.
Reuse existing area surfaces and product tokens where they match; retain exact
CSS variables and dimensions when no equivalent token exists. Keep runtime
geometry and styles owned by external rendering engines at their existing dynamic
boundary. Configure shared primitives through their documented props when those
props reproduce the existing appearance. The [progressive StyleX migration note](../notes/implemented/simplification/2026-10-04-complex-surfaces-stylex.md) records the retained legacy overrides and
the current application of these rules.

Settings' `CompactRow` keeps its label and helper in separate text nodes. Its
optional `labelId` and `helperId` let a caller associate a control with those
nodes through `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`; visual adjacency alone
does not name a control. The Preferences switches use this association with the
existing translated copy. See the
[decision and browser regression](../notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-10-01-preferences-switch-names.md).

`--input` is the theme's raw `input.background` and doubles as a muted chip/composer
slab, so in a light theme it can sit below the page color and read as a disabled field.
`--input-field` is derived in `lib/vscode-theme/vscode-theme-css.ts` as the lighter of
the field and page colors, which keeps a dark theme's raised fill and lifts a light
theme's field onto the page. Keeping gray exclusively for `disabled:bg-muted` is what
makes disabled state legible at all.

## Emoji picker dataset

`frimousse` fetches its dataset from a public CDN by default, which leaves the picker
spinning forever in an offline desktop or mobile app. The bundled dataset is a URL
contract rather than an import: the library builds `${emojibaseUrl}/${locale}/…` paths at
runtime, so a hashed `?url` asset cannot satisfy it and a host that forgets the Vite
plugin ships an empty picker. Anchoring on `document.baseURI` fails for the same class of
reason — the router uses browser history, so a deep route resolves the dataset path
against the route and the dev server answers with the SPA fallback HTML.

## Codex reset forecast

`SessionUsagePopover` is mounted per open tab and side chat, hidden ones included, and
`ProviderRow` per provider, so a mount-time fetch of the third-party forecast was a
request storm. Loading only when a user opens a surface, coalescing concurrent callers
onto one in-flight request, and clamping the served `Cache-Control: max-age` to 1m–5m
(the endpoint's CDN-shaped 4h is wrong for someone who just opened the panel) keep it to
roughly one 304 per interaction. An always-visible composer band was rejected because it
would have to load in the background to know whether to render at all.

The parser also normalizes `scheduled_reset` independently of `active_watch`. Both entry
points and the dialog prioritize an announced schedule over the forecast probability.
The local scheduled time is optional; crossing it shows pending execution confirmation.
See the [API compatibility decision](../notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-10-02-codex-scheduled-reset.md).
