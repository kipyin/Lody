# E2EE foundation boundary

Status: draft
Translation: current

[中文](e2ee-foundations.zh.md)

A client receiving encrypted bytes first needs an unambiguous format and a
signature tied to the organization and document it intended to open. The
foundation package provides that check without enabling an encrypted workspace.

The caller supplies the independently trusted organization genesis, document
resource, epoch, purpose and signing public key. None is trusted merely because
it appears in a packet or URL. Content v0 retains `docEpoch = 0`; unsupported
versions and generations fail. Encoding remains fixed: version byte, u32be Org
epoch, u16be document epoch, 32-byte signing key, 24-byte nonce, ciphertext/tag,
64-byte signature. Document context binds genesis and resource; purpose and
optional external binding participate in authentication. The four document
update/snapshot purposes share key-derivation context, not authentication bytes.

Byte wrappers copy public material. Canonical CBOR rejects alternate encodings,
trailing input and unsupported types, with size/depth/array limits. Strict Ed25519
rejects invalid signatures and noncanonical or mixed-torsion signing keys.

Signature validity is only one prerequisite. This package does not verify current
membership, freshness, write permission, snapshot history or server admission.
The separate AEAD primitive derives a scoped content key with HKDF-SHA-256 and
validates XChaCha20-Poly1305 tags using caller-supplied context/header and binding.
New encryption requires a secure random 24-byte nonce. Tag validity alone does
not establish author identity or authority. It does not expose a signer, private-key export, platform storage,
transport or production feature switch. Platform custody and full content opening
remain separate work. This draft is not product or all-platform acceptance.
