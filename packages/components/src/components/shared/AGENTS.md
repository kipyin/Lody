# Shared surface components

Parent `AGENTS.md` files also apply. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file; edit
`AGENTS.md` only.

- `MenuOptionSearchList` places search above the results; only options scroll.
  It stays content-sized within the host's cap. Never reserve
  unfiltered dimensions or keep an old popup origin to prevent query-driven layout
  changes; the desktop host must preserve its normal trigger-row anchor. Intent:
  [composer submenu placement](../../../../../specs/composer-run-config-submenu-placement.md).
- The live agent status (`AgentActivityRow` in `ai-gui/view.tsx`, and the collapsed
  group label it hands the status to) shimmers via `.agent-shimmer`, which animates only
  `transform`. Never switch it to a `background-position`/text-clip shimmer, canvas
  loop, React animation state or timer: those repaint every frame while an agent
  works. Keep the Storybook Playwright render budgets passing.
- `ZoomableImageViewer` is the one image viewer, and it presents per
  surface: full-bleed on touch, a lightbox on desktop (inset photo, translucent mask, a
  top bar that clears the native window controls and centers its controls on their
  line — the y=23 traffic-light row on macOS, the 36px caption strip on Windows).
  Inset the photo with a transform
  only — `react-photo-view` positions the box it sized itself, so a capped
  `width`/`height` decenters it and padding erases a small image. Its portal sits at
  `--z-image-viewer`, deliberately UNDER `--z-toast`, because the viewer's own copy/save
  confirmations are toasts.
- The shared image viewer is modal: trap focus, isolate the background, use named
  native buttons, and restore the opener without replacing the image gesture engine.
  [Decision](../../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-30-image-viewer-modal-focus.md).
- Desktop image preview copy/save (`lib/image-preview-export.ts`) is Electron-only and splits by
  what each process can reach: main owns the native menu, clipboard, and save dialog;
  the renderer owns the `blob:` bytes and sends them only after the user picks an
  action. Copy re-encodes to PNG (the one format the system clipboard takes); save keeps
  the original encoding. Without the preload bridge the right-click must fall through to
  the browser's own menu.
- Touch long-press observes the same photo engine without capturing or cancelling its
  pan/pinch events. Cancel on movement, another touch, release, dismissal or image identity
  change. Export the menu's exact image, never the gallery's later selection. The touch menu
  stays inside the viewer's focus boundary and above its photo layer. Native Save/Share reuse
  the file share sheet; completion is an OS handoff, not proof of an album save. Unsupported
  bitmap clipboard/file sharing stays unavailable, never a URL/text substitute.
