# Settings surfaces

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.
Parent `AGENTS.md` files also apply.

Settings owns the workspace catalog surfaces (Providers, MCP servers, Agent
Roles). The catalog's durability rule — a local Flock write is durable, and the
upload that follows it is not something a settings surface waits on, reports, or
rolls back — is in the root [AGENTS.md](../../../../../AGENTS.md).

## Layout and components

- Desktop overlay close is `absolute` on the RIGHT pane only (equal `top`/`right`
  inset); the pane's in-scroll `padding-right` keeps chrome off that column.
- Settings style in StyleX from `surface.ts`/`compact-layout.tsx`. The desktop pane
  header names every page; a page hands it actions and a one-line lead through
  `settings-page-header.tsx`, never its own title. Groups are flat in `settingsFlat`
  (pane, project window), else cards. Group by meaning, no one-row groups; a helper
  says what the label cannot. Split master/detail by fill; type: `type.stylex.ts`.
- Preferences grammar: `CompactRow`, one answer; records: name, state, menu/detail.
  Its four switches bind translated labels and rendered helpers.
- `share-management-setting.tsx` lists published static copies via the scoped cloud
  query. Ordinary members see their publications; admins see the workspace inventory.
  Draft uploads are not published shares. Reuse `useSessionShareLinkActions` for
  copy/reset/revoke; settings must never reconstruct a credential from cloud data.
  Key state by user/workspace and gate the whole surface with `teamSharing`.
  A share outlives its source, so both "View conversation" and "Update deployment"
  require the session in the local metadata cache; opening it closes the desktop
  settings overlay. Rationale:
  [share inventory jump](../../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-09-15-share-inventory-session-jump.md).

- Desktop Settings > Projects stacks every source (each machine, then GitHub
  owners) as a `CompactSection` of ruled project rows. Clicking a project opens
  a nested project window (header, page tabs) — never inline the editor beside the list.
  Mobile keeps the previous stacked list. Local-project deletion reuses
  `useRemoveLocalProject` / `RemoveLocalProjectDialog` (nested overlay like MCP);
  do not add a second confirm. Pending removal stays listed until the owning
  machine finishes. Do not RPC-probe worktree/skills on offline remotes, and
  never surface `machine_rpc_unavailable` as an editor error. The GitHub source
  row must paint from `lody:githubReposCache` on first frame; do not wait on
  `listWorkspaceReposWithStatus` to decide whether GitHub exists.
- Settings rows (`compact-layout.tsx`) give labels remaining width and controls their
  content width. Never size columns from viewport breakpoints: the panel
  clips controls. Desktop Settings nav follows panel width; keep categories/drafts,
  reveal the selection and wrap actions.
- Agent configuration lives in `agent-config-dialog.tsx` plus `env-vars-textarea.tsx`.
  DeepSeek Harness official vs custom endpoint is dialog form state only: persist
  `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` / `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` (official always writes
  `https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic`) and never a new AgentConfigMeta field. Model ids come from
  the endpoint's OpenAI-compatible discovery response during live verification; official
  Messages and legacy Chat roots share the provider's official `/models` endpoint. Do not
  add a parallel manual catalog field. Additional env cannot override either connection
  key, and changing endpoint or credential invalidates the dialog's prior live
  verification.
- Keep three.js/R3F behind the lazy usage-calendar module so lightweight and SSR
  consumers never evaluate its renderer graph.
- Charts follow [timeline rules](../../../../../specs/usage-timeline.md).
  Cache bounded day snapshots per auth session/workspace/date for one hour;
  refresh expiry without blanking data. Keep auth/capability gates
  ([cache](../../../../../specs/usage-detail-cache.md)).
- Interface/terminal fonts exclude symbol families in `lib/local-fonts.ts`; option
  names stay on the default interface font. Five tiers write `--ui-font-size`;
  sizes use `@lody/ui` text tokens. Font ligatures in the Text group writes
  `--lody-font-ligatures` for conversation, code, and tool output.
- Provider rows show identity, read-only remaining quota, a direct flat forecast
  action, and a persistent Provider `…` menu. The forecast action opens its dialog
  in one step; no quota-details interstitial or forecast probability belongs in
  the overview. Listing rows does not fetch forecasts:
  [../codex-reset/AGENTS.md](../codex-reset/AGENTS.md).
- The usage share card is a fixed-format report, not a second `ChatShareCard`:
  fixed aspects, period = page range, headline = range total.
  Derive numbers through `usage-share-stats.ts` (stamp the metric on stats,
  never pass it beside them). Money: `formatUsdCompact` headline,
  `formatUsdTight` cells — never `truncate`. Tokens/member anonymity are
  defaults; cost substitutes for tokens; member slices never include email.
  Both cards reuse `lib/share-image-export.ts` and `components/share-theme-scope.ts`;
  never fork them. Pinned cards bind product and avatar StyleX themes locally;
  inherited aliases keep the app's resolved colours.
  `StatsSettingsView` gates its lazy dialog with opt-in `shareCard` for public-landing
  reuse. Type and spacing use `TEXT`, `PAD_X`, and `RHYTHM`, never fresh `text-[…]`
  or off-grid padding. `PAD_X` aligns every band, including the footer.
  `ASPECT_SIZE` includes the backdrop; size against the
  48px-shorter framed case. Keep every band but the headline `shrink-0`.
  The graphic follows the range
  (hour skyline, day-by-hour grid, or 53-week calendar, as on the Usage screen);
  every kind fits the one `GRAPHIC_H` box so card height never depends on range. Leave the space beside the headline empty.

## Agent Roles

Roles are read and written from Settings, mentioned from the composer, and
resolved by CLI MCP creation, so these are cross-surface rules rather than
component details.

- Before changing Role settings or dispatch, read the authoritative
  [shared Role contracts](../../../../shared/AGENTS.md#workspace-mcp-and-agent-roles).
  The editor clears its memory reference when the target machine changes;
  discovery and creation use that exact machine's Provider RPC. Memory settings
  reuse Agents machine tabs/pills and catalog rows. A missing nmem install stays
  on the page with the provider URL; it must not open a blocking dialog.
  The Role Memory tab lists saved machine-Flock associations and shares the
  Configuration tab's draft/save boundary. Role settings retain all machine groups;
  memory shortcuts locate a group without adding machine tabs or filtering. Only a ready Provider
  inventory can mark an identity missing; deleting a link never deletes provider data.

## Workspace ownership

- Ownership transfer is an owner-only danger-zone slot shared by desktop and mobile.
  `workspace-ownership-transfer.tsx` collects an existing member and exact workspace
  name, then calls the cloud mutation through `account-setting.tsx`. Refresh session
  and active organization after success; cache refresh failure must not claim transfer
  failed. Card changes use the billing Portal separately; transfer keeps the current card.
