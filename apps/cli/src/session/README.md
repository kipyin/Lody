# apps/cli/src/session

Session lifecycle on the daemon side: watching for user turns, running them through an ACP
agent, and the sagas around them (fork, edit-and-resend, preparation, worktrees). Binding
rules live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [worktree/AGENTS.md](worktree/AGENTS.md); this file
is the responsibility index and background.

Dispatch architecture: context/message-flow.md — user turns arrive by being written into the
session doc (meta pointers), not via a message bus. The WS/DO path is DEPRECATED. The
CLI/MCP orchestration contract is specs/session-orchestration.md.

## Files

- `session-dispatch-watcher.ts` — the current dispatch entry: watches
  `repo.watch('doc-metadata')` plus a per-session mirror subscribe and dispatches when
  the shared pending-activation predicate identifies work. Also accepts `session/dispatch-turn`
  Machine RPC pushes via `offerRpcTurn`, which stash the payload as a third turn source
  (history → queue → stash) and wake the per-session check chain. That RPC ack means delivered, not
  authorized or executed. Its extensive header comment
  is the authoritative doc for edge cases (stale pointers, history/meta sync races).
- `session-dispatch-logic.ts` — pure decision functions for the watcher (testable).
- `roost-node-session.ts` — owns Roost history reads/writes and its bounded active-branch
  page cache; `roost-session-backend.ts` joins it to the existing Loro control plane.
- `roost-history-generation.ts` — stages structural replacements privately and
  atomically activates them, fencing writes through superseded handles.
- `roost-rpc-session.ts` — one-shot Cloud CLI history services backed by owner RPC;
  `lib/command-runtime.ts` supplies the same composition for sessions, export and MCP.
- `turn-history-gate.ts` — ordering barrier for RPC fast-path turns. Created in
  message-handler's `beginConversationTurn`, stored/disposed via `SessionTransientStore` turn
  state; it creates the assistant entry when it opens.
- `session-execution-service.ts` — runs one turn end-to-end: ACP prompt, turn ids,
  lifecycle/error handling, GitHub/local project setup, and post-turn diffStats.
- `acp-session-config-applier.ts` — applies turn configuration and reports rejected
  model selections through the GUI warning path, retaining the agent's actual model.
- `session-execution-helpers.ts` — composes first-task prompt context, with branch-naming
  guidance only after execution verifies this Session's temporary branch in an ordinary
  new independent GitHub/local worktree.
- `acp-error-classification.ts` — JSON-RPC/transport error string matching for the above.
- `session-manager.ts` / `session.ts` / `session-sandbox.ts` / `terminal-manager.ts` —
  session and process lifecycle, workdirs, worktrees, sandboxed spawning, ACP terminals.
  Managed GitHub credential preparation excludes local projects and their worktrees;
  each managed runtime owns a scoped credential lease, retained across adoption.
- `session-preparation-service.ts` — process-local speculative ACP lease/state owner.
- `session-fork-service.ts` / `session-fork-operation-store.ts` — the fork saga and its
  machine-local marker store.
- `session-edit-and-resend-service.ts` — same-session replacement of the last normal User turn.
- `session-launch-config-resolver.ts` — durable launch config resolution.
- `workspace-git-service.ts` — observes checkout branches for local folders and worktrees,
  serializes reads/writes per owner Session, and publishes the last named branch. Execution
  binds, terminal turns, and authorized Code Collab activation/refresh use this service;
  observation requires neither a running agent nor a GitHub remote.
- `turn-post-processing-service.ts` — post-turn work (titles, notifications, diff stats,
  and the `workspaceDirty`/`workspaceUnpushed` probes that drive the Info Bar's
  Commit & Push action; both cancellation routes refresh the branch and run `syncWorkspaceGitState`,
  which self-gates on the session's GitHub binding).
- `session-diff-stats-target.ts` — chooses which writer owns a session's `diffStats`.
- `session-access-policy.ts` — local-first dispatch access precheck (optimistic-allow cache,
  D11). It may allow owner-cached turns from the catalog snapshot, deny `remote_missing`
  workspaces, or return `remote` to preserve the existing Convex three-state path. Catalog read
  failures degrade to `remote`, never to an error.
- `session-access-retry.ts` — remote machine access verification: bounded retries at command
  validation boundaries and interruptible unbounded retries for an already-durable dispatch.
- `session-user-resolver.ts` + `git-identity.ts` — the requesting user's commit identity.
- `worktree/` — repo checkouts, worktrees, branch allocation, setup scripts
  ([AGENTS.md](worktree/AGENTS.md)). `worktree-gc.ts` reconciles the Lody-managed
  worktree tree against Session state: archived or deleted root Sessions lose their
  directory (after a backup commit, branch kept); contract in
  [specs/session-worktree-lifecycle.md](../../../../specs/session-worktree-lifecycle.md).

## Background

### Frozen execution input

Create, continue and steer resolve effective input through shared
`resolveSessionExecutionInputBlocks`: the accepted turn's `prompt` owns text,
while `inputBlocks` provide structured attachments and retain authored text for
editing. Dispatch preserves both fields and supplies legacy history fallback.
Execution never reconstructs instructions from the current Role catalog. Runtime
context and attachment materialization remain daemon responsibilities. See the
[decision and regression evidence](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-10-08-frozen-turn-execution-input.md).

### Why turn activation has its own predicate

Fast-path turns that finish before their history entry syncs are reconciled by
`maybeRepairAlreadyHandledTurn`. Missing-history delivery recovery records
`lastMissingHistoryUserMsgId`, and a stale activation whose entry is already terminal is
retired into `settledActivationUserMsgId`. Both slots retire an activation while deliberately
leaving `latestUserMsgId` and `lastHandledUserMsgId` unequal, so a consumer that compares the
two pointers itself sees pending work forever: GC
never reclaims it, MCP reports a phantom queued turn. That is why
`hasPendingUserTurnActivation` in `@lody/shared` is the single answer, and why
`packages/shared/tests/dispatch-activation-predicate.test.ts` fails on any new comparison.

There is no CAS against the LWW map, so rewriting `latestUserMsgId` to retire an activation
would let a send published between the read and the write lose its activation and go unwatched
and unrun. The `settledActivationUserMsgId` slot may be replaced freely because the turn it
names is terminal.

The renderer derives a visible "not delivered" label for a marked entry from the marker plus
its non-terminal status — no CLI repair write, no schema change. Recovery is a fresh send: the
label opens a confirmation dialog that re-sends the SAME content as a brand-new message
through the ordinary producer path. The renderer retains the marker as a tombstone and
supersedes the abandoned entry to `canceled`; it must never revive the old turn.

### Bootstrap scan cost

Owned-session startup and meta bootstrap scans may cover thousands of rooms, and the scan is
idempotent but costs seconds of main-thread work. `enqueueBootstrap` folds concurrent requests
into a single queued drain (`pendingBootstrapReasons` + `bootstrapChain`); none are dropped. A
per-trigger scan is not acceptable because `onMetaRoomSynced` fires on Streams recovery, so a
misread transport edge would turn into an O(rooms) scan every few seconds. Coalescing bounds
the work per trigger, not the trigger rate; keeping that rate sane is the connection recovery
boundary's job, and `onMetaRoomSynced` is rate-limited in `../lib/loro/connection-recovery.ts`
while the cheap "back online" edge moved to `onStreamsOnline`
(context/code-collab-flow.md).

### Per-session check chain cost

The dispatch branch of a session check awaits the whole agent turn, and the session mirror
fires a check on every commit while the agent streams, so a long turn accumulates hundreds of
triggers behind the blocked chain. Each check re-reads the full history (about 130 ms on a
13 MB session doc) and settles every await on microtasks, so an uncoalesced drain pinned the
daemon for up to 42 s without ever reaching the timer phase. `enqueueSessionCheck` therefore
reuses a queued check that has not started yet — at most one follow-up per turn — and a check
that follows another one in the chain yields one macrotask first
([note](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-13-dispatch-check-coalescing.md)).

### Turn ordering

Turn-scoped history LIST writes (assistant entry, ACP flushes, finalization, failure notices)
wait until the user turn entry has synced into the CLI-local doc, because concurrent Loro list
inserts can otherwise permanently order the reply before the user message. Status and meta map
writes are never gated; some sit on the prompt critical path.

### Why the pointer write is bundled with the history append

`latestUserMsgId` is the producer-owned metadata activation, separate from history transport.
`SessionDocument.appendUserTurn` bundles history acceptance with publication so idle watchers
and startup can discover an ordinary send. Durable create and edit-and-resend publish their
own producer activation; execution start, completion, and steer handoff never rewrite it.

Refused steers use daemon-owned `steerTurnStatuses[userTurnId] = 'pending'`. A history-only
status change would not wake an idle watcher, while reusing the latest pointer could erase a
newer send. The shared activation predicate includes these exact-id pending records; ordinary
claim and missing-history failure acknowledge only that record. The same map retains steer
status/provenance until the exact history row arrives. Terminal projections clear their
records; applied processing stays recorded until execution ends. After restart, an abandoned
applied processing record becomes canceled, never an ordinary replay.

The execution service does not decide that interruption means non-delivery. AgentClient returns
`applied`, `not-applied`, or `unknown`; only `not-applied` can move a steer back to ordinary
dispatch, and only when the cancellation boundary selected `pendingInput: 'promote'`. User Stop
selects promotion, while internal cancellation such as Edit & Resend and access revocation
preserves the pending input. `unknown` becomes `delivery_unknown` in history. The UI offers a
confirmed fresh send with a duplicate-work warning, never an automatic retry. RPC application
ACKs update presentation only; the execution service alone projects processing and terminal
steer status, so delayed ACKs cannot resurrect canceled or completed history.

Stop and target completion abort local steer waits before entering the serialized completion
lane. A submitted request keeps its late verdict outside that lane and its rewrite lease.
Raw prompt/steer requests and configuration work remain in the owner's five-second drain;
termination failure keeps ownership. Steer configuration checks the local signal before each
subsequent mutation. Already-applied handoff commits before queued completion can run.

Cancellation separately selects the pre-prompt process lifetime. Stop and access revocation
discard it; Edit & Resend keeps it because preparation has already created the replacement
inside that same ACP process. Creation/restoration retain their cancellation fences until
initialization completes; those fences must not override a later `keep` during configuration.
Binding a ready session alone does not authorize termination.

History promotion and activation can fail independently. `promotion-failed` preserves proof
of non-delivery. `recoveryOwned` tells the renderer not to publish a conflicting activation;
it retries that proven failure once through the daemon and surfaces persistent failure.
Legacy replies retain ordinary dispatch repair for pending_apply/pending/seen. Active,
terminal, and removed entries are left alone; unknown delivery never takes this retry path.

Foreground ACP configuration runs with the owner Effect's `AbortSignal`. Each mutation checks
that signal before the next mutation, so an old turn whose first configuration call finishes
late cannot overwrite the configuration of the turn that started after Stop.

### Why resume reopens the assistant entry

Teardown and cancel finalize (`message-handler.ts` `finalizeACPState`, no-turnId overload)
stamps `finished=true`/`endedAt` on the in-progress entry, and
`assistant-turn-finalize.ts` `markAssistantTurnFinished` is a no-op on an already-finished one
because those callers fire per live session at app close. Without the reopen reset, a
machine-death-then-resume turn streams new output into a `finished=true` entry: the web
renderer folds the still-streaming turn into a `Worked for …` summary and shared "active
assistant entry" logic (`@lody/shared` `schema.ts` terminal predicate) treats it as done.
Renderer side: [packages/components/src/components/ai-gui/AGENTS.md](../../../../packages/components/src/components/ai-gui/AGENTS.md).

### Why a resolved prompt is not proof of success

Nothing reads `PromptResponse.stopReason`, and an adapter may swallow an upstream failure and
resolve normally — observed: an over-context request answered with HTTP 400, kept only in the
agent's own session file — so `handleTurnError` never sees it. The no-output guard is the
backstop.

### Why output capture is mandatory for result-bearing spawns

`spawn()` does async post-spawn work (pid wait, resource profile, cgroup attach), and under a
stalled event loop a short command exits and its stdio is destroyed — dropping buffered output
— before the caller subscribes. `exec()` then resolves `''` and also ignores the exit code, so
a failed command is indistinguishable from an empty one. This is what made a session that had
just opened a PR report "detached HEAD" and never associate it. Long-lived ACP stdio
deliberately does not capture: it streams and would grow unbounded.

### Why an unsplit terminal command line falls back to `sh -c`

ACP `terminal/create` carries the executable in `command` and its argv in `args`, and that pair
is spawned directly. Some agents instead send the whole shell line in `command` with empty `args`
(a bare `ls -al`, or a relayed `bash -lc …`). Spawned literally, no such executable exists: on
Linux the cgroup sandbox awaits the child's pid and the agent sees an untyped errno `-2`, while
on the darwin fallback the handle resolves first, so `terminal/create` returns an id whose
`wait_for_exit` never completes.

The fallback is deliberately narrow — empty `args`, whitespace in `command`, and no file at
that path — so a spec-conformant call is untouched and an executable whose path contains a
space is still spawned directly. The shell is non-interactive and non-login (`sh -c`, not
`bash -lc`): the agent asked for one command, not for the user's login profile to run and
change its environment. A spawn that still fails answers with a JSON-RPC code instead of a bare
errno, and its error is recorded as an exit status so no waiter is left pending.

### Imported ACP identity

Continuation and fork use the shared `resolveSessionAcpTargetId` projection: a
Lody-owned runtime supersedes the immutable imported source; an unresolved source
history conflict cannot authorize native fork. Import does not fabricate a live
runtime id. Fork copies an ACP runtime configuration baseline only when it belongs
to the copied last user turn and source ACP identity, rebasing it to the new native
session id. Ordinary and worktree forks use the same projection and fence.

### Fork saga recovery

Because a preparing target publishes no Session meta until its final commit, the repo meta
index cannot name interrupted operations; recovery discovers them from the machine-local
marker store (`session-fork-operation-store.ts`), recorded fail-closed at accept and cleared
only after the final commit or rollback persists. The marker carries the worktree-cleanup
payload, so recovery never opens the source doc. A marker surviving startup is by construction
an anomaly, so recovery opens the named target doc and judges from it with the client's own
terminal criteria — never the meta record, whose write is not flush-atomic with the doc's. The
saga commits doc writes first (history BEFORE the flag clear) and publishes meta last, so a
durable `acpSessionId` implies the doc writes landed. A stale preparing flag with landed
history must be cleared, or the client's fork observer can reach neither terminal branch and
waits forever. Doc-landed-but-meta-missing is repaired by republishing meta from the marker
payload with `acpSessionId` absent.

Recovery must never enumerate session rooms or open docs to find candidates: each open joins
the room and pulls its stream, so a full scan is O(all historical sessions) of Streams
subscriptions at every daemon start (see [../lib/loro/AGENTS.md](../lib/loro/AGENTS.md)).

### GitHub credential broker

Managed GitHub sessions receive a trusted conversation-owner snapshot and workspace
Git/gh adapters from `session-manager.ts`. The shared credential iterator tries
personal, eligible machine and repository App sources once, without a cloud policy
lookup. The broker supplies optional managed tokens; owner-local credentials remain
available during token-service failure. Native Git helpers use `GIT_EXEC_PATH`;
standard URLs remain standard. Host operations pin the same owner snapshot through
checkout. Managed credential helpers also cover checkout filters and LFS; non-owner
host children scrub inherited GitHub tokens. `session-credentials.ts` bridges the
broker's Effect-scoped acquisition into the existing Promise Session lifecycle.
Each acquisition has its own token and pinned file; neither enrollment nor release
uses a Session ID lookup. `SessionConfig` carries no credential policy. Preparation
owns the lease until adoption transfers it to the same Session; failures before
Session creation release it too. Validation on create, continue, recovery and steer
checks that runtime's lease and trusted owner. Owner changes revoke it and retire
the old runtime, since children retain their old environments. Operations are not replayed.

`preparation-control.ts` owns the Effect TTL fiber separately from runtime resources.
Claim closes this control scope without closing the adopted runtime's credentials.
The synchronous admission/claim facade remains; raw ACP/worktree creation is still
owned by the existing Promise lifecycle, not treated as automatically interruptible
by Effect. Retirement stays visible until cleanup succeeds; a failed cleanup blocks
same-session replacement rather than pretending resources were released. See [the contract](../../../../specs/github-identity-fallback.md) and
[worktree rules](worktree/AGENTS.md) for ownership, write non-replay and isolation.

### Commit identity

`git-identity-policy.ts` bounds the complete policy lookup to 3 seconds per attempt,
retries once, and returns personal identity disabled after two failures. Startup publishes
`Resolving Git identity`; cancellation interrupts the waiter and fences identity updates
and agent launch. Late policy results have no side effects. This deadline also covers
per-turn identity refresh; it is separate from network credential fallback.

The effective identity becomes `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*` in the session env (`session.ts`
`updateGitIdentity`, re-applied per turn via the execution service's `bindReadySession`). When
the turn requester is the machine owner, the repository/machine Git identity is used without a cloud profile lookup; missing local
identity uses neutral LodyAI. Non-owner profile queries have a 60-second deadline; failed or
timed-out entries are evicted so later turns can retry. A non-owner requester always uses their resolved
Lody/GitHub identity and can never inherit the machine owner's Git config; if no usable requester
identity exists, the neutral LodyAI identity is used. The cloud composition root owns hosted
user resolution because the daemon does not own an end-user browser session; the local access
port resolves only its synthetic owner and never performs network I/O. PR and push identity
itself comes from the conversation-owner GitHub credential, not from git config. Identity changes update the host Session environment without restarting ACP or its sandbox,
including adopted preparations. Existing ACP children retain their launch environment; live
identity propagation into adapter-owned Git commands remains unresolved.

### Speculative preparation

Peek and claim are synchronous published-resource snapshots. A prepared resource may reuse its
open target-machine Flock to synchronously resolve launch config, but dispatch and claim
rescan the current row. Durable creation claims the marker only when repo, source, and base
branch target identity match, runs setup, then permits the first prompt. A missed claim returns
any retiring cleanup barrier even after its lease has disappeared. Cold creation, discard,
replacement preparation and shutdown join that barrier, including resources returned after
cancellation. This can delay cold startup until cleanup finishes; otherwise a retired
preparation could delete the newly reused directory. Unrelated Sessions remain independent.

Memory identity references travel with turn configuration. `Session.createAgent` maps
them through `../lib/memory-providers.ts` at spawn; the execution service restarts a
resident ACP process when the next turn changes identity. See the
[memory Spec](../../../../specs/agent-role-memory.md).

## Roost history paging

The CLI uses the pinned `@loro-dev/roost-node` npm runtime for SQLite history in a
Worker. Electron stages that complete package with one target native binding.
The shared renderer uses the existing local IPC or remote history RPC bridge;
Web/iOS clients need no Node addon. The owning machine must be available for RPC
reads; browser-local IndexedDB replicas and offline sync are separate work.
Runtime packaging and verification: [native runtime note](../../../../.agents/notes/proposed/architecture/2026-10-09-roost-native-runtime.md).

Renderer read replies bind logical page bodies, count and history revision to
one durable observation. The RPC waits for local writes before and after the
read and retries a moving revision; neither barrier waits for remote sync.
This lets the renderer persist bounded pages as a coherent offline read replica
without exposing physical segments or introducing another history writer.

Display bootstrap and ordinary directory/body reads use active-branch pages and
a bounded body cache. Published-message pages cannot establish branch membership.
Resolve an off-window physical head before sealing or appending; a late successor
must not turn the next append into a new root. Full snapshots belong to explicit
export/copy/edit operations, not renderer hydration or missing-new-ID lookup.

The owner starts with 40 logical turns and keeps up to 500 page bodies for subsequent
hydration. Reverse pages carry their own total count and absolute positions. Cursor
rejection after a branch rewrite is recoverable by refreshing the loaded window;
it never authorizes switching back to Loro or reading a superseded published suffix.

ACP batch appliers can mutate item arrays. The Roost adapter applies them to a
detached working copy, preserving the before-image used to decide what to persist.
Content changes refresh only affected primary bodies. Sealed-turn corrections
use mutable SDK state records anchored to their primary; permission responses
remain independent SDK records projected onto the matching tool. Responding does
not seal the assistant or interrupt its output.
Ordinary Edit & Resend reuses the sealed prefix through the SDK's branch activation
inside the same stream/view. The Lody session id and owner saga do not change.
An application-owned signed epoch commits in that native transaction and fences
older handles. Immediate rollback restores the old SDK head; rollback with later
appends retains the existing whole-generation compensation. General structural
copy/import edits still stage a complete SDK-managed generation and publish one
signed application-owned activation with a native event-cursor CAS. Failed staging
retains the old stream; sealed envelopes and SDK indexes are never rewritten.

The local goal projection is an optional derived index tied to an exact native
event cursor. Incremental page coverage or a complete read establishes its value;
commands advance it only across their own signed write receipts and index events.
Unknown, damaged or externally invalidated projections require an authoritative
read before the active-goal guard. This cache never accepts commands or weakens
eligibility. Its failed CAS affects reuse only. Historical state/permission reads
use eight concurrent lanes; a lane issues at most one native request at a time.
Per-item ACP receipts commit with their output and remain discoverable through
prior generations, so a lost reply or overlapping retry cannot replay a prefix.
Count and position reads refresh after a lost activation reply. The local write
barrier republishes the committed projection before RPC binds its control revision;
it never retries an indeterminate history action.
External cursor refreshes share the local write queue so an earlier branch read
cannot overwrite a later mutation's projection; disposal rejects pending reads.
Cloud one-shot managers inject owner RPC services and never open a caller-local
Roost database. Open-ended directory reads clip to the owner count and use at most
500 rows per RPC, restarting when the durable revision moves. Fork and Edit & Resend
retain their owner sagas; process-local snapshot/rollback handles do not cross RPC.
The production SQLite regressions live in
[`roost-session-backend-contract.test.ts`](../../tests/roost-session-backend-contract.test.ts).
The synthetic [history benchmark](../../benchmarks/roost-history.mts) exercises
these production backends and the shared view; `BENCH_STRUCTURAL=1` also measures
the complete directory and a guarded last-user edit. Its timing excludes renderer
transport, IndexedDB and paint.

## Conversation-tree stop

The related-conversations action persists `collaborationStopped` on the creation tree.
Execution reads inherited flags before setup and ACP dispatch. Metadata updates
cancel exact active turns with pending input preserved, while late completions are
recorded without continuation. Users must explicitly restore collaboration; offline
machines enforce the state after sync. See the [orchestration contract](../../../../specs/session-orchestration.md#user-controlled-conversation-tree-stop).
