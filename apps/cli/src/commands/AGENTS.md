CLI/MCP commands and daemon dispatch.
[apps/cli/AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) applies; session-side rules are in
[../session/AGENTS.md](../session/AGENTS.md).

## Process and daemon lifecycle

- One-shot commands use `runOneShotCommand` for consistent exits/flush. Await
  application disposal after fleet cleanup; cleanup failures exit nonzero.
- Process entrypoints, command-owned boundaries, global process-error handlers, and generated
  standalone shims may force exit after their own cleanup policy: `start.ts` owns startup, fatal,
  and signal exits; `daemon-runner.ts` owns watchdog fatal and signal exits. Never force exit from
  reusable libraries, session/agent internals, TUI/watch flows, or worker code — expose cleanup
  and let the process boundary decide.
- Remote restart/upgrade: attempt a bounded ACK; even on delivery failure, accepted
  work asks `start.ts` to exit with the lifecycle code for watchdog restart/upgrade. See [ACK contract](../../../../specs/machine-lifecycle-ack.md).
- Upgrade handoff must use the verified entry from the installing npm's global root,
  never the old watchdog's argv or a PATH-resolved `lody`. Success requires the
  replacement's ready report to match the installed version; ordinary launches
  still accept legacy readiness. See [upgrade contract](../../../../specs/daemon-upgrade-installation.md).
- `lody daemon start` resolves cloud authentication in the FOREGROUND process before spawning the
  detached runner (`daemon-auth-preflight.ts`): validate the cached credential, and on a
  missing/rejected one run the interactive device-authorization flow there. An unreachable backend
  aborts instead of re-authenticating, and a non-TTY run aborts instead of blocking on a browser
  link. `--skip-auth-check` is the opt-out; `--auth` keeps its non-interactive path.
- The runner's fd 3 launch handshake reports success only after its supervised Worker reaches
  `startupStage=ready`. An initial Worker exit returns bounded output and terminates the runner
  instead of claiming success; retryable startup exits keep the handshake pending, and a timeout
  terminates and awaits the exact spawned runner before reporting failure.
- Cloud-mode `lody daemon status` reads the runtime probe's explicit `backend`
  authorization/connection state and `connectedWorkspaces`; local mode omits that cloud-only
  block. Aggregate `connectivity` is local runtime health and must not be presented as proof that
  the cached CLI token was accepted.
- Connection-age fields preserve one continuous non-connected interval across
  connecting/disconnected transitions and clear only on connected. Keep them in the top-level
  `connectionAges` v1 extension: older consumers reject unknown keys inside the strict
  backend/workspace objects. Status reports a red connection error at 60 seconds.

## Read commands and workspace sync

- Session read commands (`session list/show/history/status`, `export`) sync Loro metadata/docs
  before reading by default; sync failure is a command failure with an `--offline` hint.
  `--offline` is the explicit local-cache path, never an automatic fallback. `lody sync` is the
  explicit workspace sync command and excludes Code Collab file-index Flock docs.

## Session observation

Read the [observe Spec](../../../../specs/cli-session-observe.md).
Use isolated read-only scopes, scalar reads and bounded opens; preserve status.
Projection/release share terminal proof for metadata's latest/processing User.
Workspace queues child removal/close outside child emit callbacks.
Metadata idle/Presence loss is not completion; sequence is local.

## `lody app`

- `app.ts` registers the directory as a local project through the daemon (`local-project/add`,
  idempotent — the id is a sha256 of the resolved root path), then opens the active installation
  profile's deep link (`lody://chat/new?…` cloud, `lody-oss://chat/new?…` local). Link shape lives
  in `../lib/desktop-deep-link.ts` and both sides pin the URL in unit tests.
- INVARIANT: registration happens only in the CLI. The deep link carries ids, never a path, and
  the app must never register a project from one — any web page can navigate the OS to either
  registered protocol, so a path-carrying link would let a site hand agents an arbitrary
  directory. An unknown project id just stays unselected.
- `workspaceSlug` is present only when the daemon reported workspace candidates.
- Daemon down is not a failure: the deterministic project id is computed locally and the app still
  opens, with a warning that a brand-new directory was not registered.
- Local-project control transport and the workspace picker are shared with `lody project`
  (`../lib/local-project-control-client.ts`).

## `lody review` (no-login HTML review)

- `review.ts` involves no Lody login: it resolves `.review.md` against the local Git repo
  read-only, and a render failure prints `error.message` with `process.exitCode = 1`.
- The ~8 MB viewer is NOT bundled. `../lib/review-viewer.ts` fetches `standalone.html` at the EXACT
  version the CLI was built against, verifies its sha256, and caches it under
  `~/.lody/code-review-viewer/`. `LODY_REVIEW_VIEWER` overrides the source for offline/mirror use
  and stays sha-verified. The pinned version and sha come from the bundled-at-build
  `lody-code-review-viewer/manifest` import, and the release pipeline must publish the viewer at
  the same version before the CLI. Keep the agent prompt embedded and lazy-imported.

## Session create and dispatch (`session.ts`)

- `--local-project … --worktree` sets `ProjectRef.useWorktree`; daemon startup consumes it in
  `../session/session-execution-service.ts` and worktree creation happens in
  `../session/session-manager.ts`.
- Direct/worktree local create records the Git remote's GitHub repository, matching desktop.
  Remote identity is not authorization: the PR reconciler uses authenticated GitHub reads,
  never a product-cloud registry. Absent/unreadable remotes leave creation local.
- Dispatch point-of-no-rollback (`createSessionResult` / `sendSessionChatResult`):
  `writeDispatchPointer` commits `latestUserMsgId` and enables execution. AWAIT
  `confirmDispatchSyncedBestEffort` before transport teardown; it must NEVER throw.
  The durable pointer and SQLite Operation own delivery.
  Create/chat may unwind only before dispatch (`if (!dispatched)`). Never roll back
  a dispatched Session or introduce a hard-fail Streams acknowledgement.
- MCP create combines semantic controls with `modeId`/`configOptionValues` via shared
  `acp-run-config.ts`. Validate advertised ids/types/values without requiring permission
  categories. Raw selectors override inherited scalars; reject legacy Plan/mode conflicts.
  `validateSessionCreateOptions({ dispatchConfig })` validates before acceptance;
  freeze each effective target config and use it for recovery, never mutable history.
- `--agent-role` uses shared `../lib/agent-role-create.ts`: clear manual target/run-config
  flags with a stderr warning; freeze Role id/revision/snapshot. Preserve work context/parent.
- Local daemon IPC sends the real control request once; do not restore a health preflight. Native
  `LocalDaemonAvailabilityError` must be thrown outside the Effect runtime boundary so MCP can
  preserve `DAEMON_NOT_RUNNING` versus retryable `DAEMON_BUSY`: a connection refusal means not
  running, timeout/408/429/5xx means busy.
- Renderer joins must not call `LoroDocumentManager.getOrCreateSessionDoc` or retain
  cloud rooms. Use bounded raw-doc reconciliation in `../lib/loro/doc.ts`, cancel on
  local leave/Session activation, and unload renderer-only docs after the last peer
  leaves. Metadata/RPC activation owns persistent cloud joins; Flock bridging stays
  paired to local join/leave.

## Agent config output

- `agent-config-output.ts` owns the allowlisted inspection DTO; never spread a stored
  config into output. Default show emits only `envKeys`; raw values require show-only
  `--show-secrets`. Mutations emit receipts. Assignment errors never echo input.
