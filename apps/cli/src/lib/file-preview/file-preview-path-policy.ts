 * segment to the directory it is standing in — either the requested name
 * verbatim, or a single listed entry that folds to it — and `.`/`..` are
 * refused outright, so the walk cannot climb, jump absolute, or invent a
 * segment. Whatever it returns still goes through the unchanged
 * symlink-resolved, case-SENSITIVE containment check below, so a directory that
 * is a symlink out of the root is still rejected there, exactly as before.
 * (The walk may LIST a directory outside the root when it is reached through
 * such a symlink; it can still never return a readable path from one.)
 *
 * Why it has to exist, precisely — the two halves are not the same claim:
 * - NFC/NFD is a RESTORATION. `code-collab/open-text` resolved it
 *   (`resolveExistingPathWithoutConflicts`), v3 replaced that with a raw
 *   `path.resolve`, and files that had always opened stopped opening. A file
 *   index holding the NFC spelling of a name stored on disk as NFD is routine.
 * - Letter case is NEW tolerance. `open-text` never resolved it: its match test
 *   is `entry.name === segment` then NFC-equality, so `readme.md` never found
 *   `README.md` there either. Folding case is a deliberate widening for agents
 *   that write a path from memory with the wrong case on a case-sensitive
 *   volume. Note that WRITES stay case-exact — see the asymmetry recorded in
 *   this directory's AGENTS.md.
 *
 * Ambiguity declines instead of guessing: if more than one entry answers to the
 * folded spelling, the caller keeps its `file_not_found`.
 *
 * Exported for its own unit tests — see `FilePreviewDirectoryReader` for why the
 * fold rule cannot be exercised through the public entry point on a typical
 * development machine.
