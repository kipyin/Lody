# iOS Simulator

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. CLI ancestor rules apply.

- `service.ts` owns ephemeral workspace/session preview operations; `control-leases.ts`
  is the machine Worker singleton that excludes other sessions across workspaces.
  Acquire before boot/download, revoke inputs and join cleanup before release. A stale
  operation must never release a replacement lease. Do not persist devices, frames,
  credentials or heartbeats in Repo metadata. Only the UUID `iosSimulatorPreviewRequestId`
  may publish agent-start discovery, never live state/authority; publication is best-effort.
- `devices.ts` owns simctl listing/boot; `host-controls.ts` owns fixed device controls.
  Validate foreign JSON and UDIDs; invoke argv directly. Listing never downloads a runtime, starts devices or opens a tunnel.
- `gateway.ts` exposes only the fixed viewer, bound device stream and typed private
  control endpoint. It is behind the authenticated preview proxy; never forward arbitrary Baguette requests. Validate every input and active lease. Frames/status probes do not renew
  idle expiry; only explicit viewer heartbeat or valid input does.
- WS/RTC share validation and teardown; never replay input. Local viewers stay offline.
  Lift single before dual; release both together. Keep ICE credentials ephemeral.
- `guest-buttons.ts` owns the preview-local Home/App Switcher/Lock helper. Compile only
  bundled source with the installed simulator SDK into a private temporary directory;
  bind one guest service to the device; acknowledge releases, never replay uncertain
  commands, join teardown. Never restart SpringBoard. Prewarm failure preserves video.
- `device-controls.ts` maps the shared control union to fixed loopback routes. Text
  uses `host-controls.ts` to write the device clipboard, then sends acknowledged Cmd-V.
  The IPC worker owns fixed simctl/devicectl commands for text, appearance,
  shake and deep links; abort joins child close before release. Do not delegate these to
  Baguette's subprocess paths: they can outlive the native server. Control bodies/errors never enter logs or RPC.
  iPhone/iPad preparation disables device-local `AutomaticMinimizationEnabled` and
  notifies keyboard preferences so the guest software keyboard remains available.
  Never rewrite host-global Simulator preferences or reboot to change keyboards.
  Negotiate `iosSimulatorControls: 1`.
- `exterior.ts` reads only the bound device's fixed definition/bezel routes, strips all
  upstream URLs, and validates geometry plus bounded PNG dimensions. The gateway serves
  these behind the same private capability; resource reads never renew the lease.
  The separately negotiated `exterior {udid}` read uses fixed `chrome layout/composite`
  CLI arguments without boot, lease or server. Its bounded static artwork (256 KiB PNG)
  may cross authenticated RPC; never include screen pixels, paths or capabilities.
  Serialize reads, bound the in-memory cache, and recheck authorization before replying.
- `h264-codec.ts` validates the pinned progressive AVC layout and reference numbers;
  reject unknown layouts to MJPEG. `h264-flow.ts` owns ordered video credit, bounded
  queues and IDR recovery. Change bitrate from multi-sample ACK windows, never a
  single delayed ACK; idle deltas do not prove spare bandwidth. Never latest-drop encoded deltas; native backlog gaps must
  invalidate the reference chain too. Optional input-driven resets require immediate IDR
  eligibility; never discard a valid replacement during cooldown/credit/pacing waits.
  Decoder ACK/recovery/config never renew leases.
  `viewer-h264.ts` probes the actual avcC configuration, bounds queues, closes all
  VideoFrames and fences async probes. ACK decoded H.264 output independently of RAF;
  retain only one unpainted picture with a bounded paint timer. Decoder pressure waits
  for capacity; encoded overflow or missing decoded progress invalidates the chain.
  Reset the recovery budget only after sustained decoded progress, never idle time or
  one output. Fence dequeue callbacks and cancel progress timers on hide. Codec failures fall back
  once to MJPEG; transport failures retry H.264 at most twice per iframe, then stop.
  Hiding cancels retry/paint timers; reconnect never replays controls or touches.
- `frame-flow.ts` owns sequenced JPEGs, cumulative receiver credit and the latest-only
  pending frame. Keep both frame/byte windows bounded; a local socket's bufferedAmount
  is not receiver backpressure. ACK/config/probe traffic never renews the lease.
  `viewer-media.ts` owns RAF decoding, recovery watchdogs and move coalescing;
  preserve touch-up/final coordinates and cancel scheduled work on disconnect.
  Remote pacing/byte credit use conservative payload completion and minimum RTT;
  congested RTT must not expand credit. Scale combines viewport/SOF with network
  feedback, capped at 4; never forward arbitrary native reconfiguration. Recover
  quality slowly. Keep ACK/RTT feedback for flow control; do not restore performance
  sampling, histories or periodic media logs.
  Native MJPEG FPS remains unfixed. `idle-refresh.ts` owns one bounded sharp JPEG
  after a drained quiet period; input/source changes revoke pending stills, and
  disconnect joins cancelled capture. Fixed loopback capture never renews a lease.
- `viewer.ts` is fixed iframe HTML, without React/annotation injection. Parent commands
  bind source, origin and operation. Opaque init requires the exact parent, operation,
  boolean visibility and one port; bind once, reject later window commands, and reply
  only through that port, never `*`. Capture PNGs are bounded and request-bound.
  JPEG keeps one active and one replaceable pending frame. Release touches
  on blur/cancel/disconnect. Wheel input uses the same touch protocol, releasing on
  idle and before pointer takeover. Bottom-7% gestures retain `edge: bottom` through
  release; the gateway validates start band and rejects mid-gesture edge changes.
  Authenticated init chooses mobile upright or desktop-following display rotation;
  layout/input/capture share that angle, independent of native rotation.
- Use `@lody/shared/node/process`; keep EOF release and join bounded tree cleanup.
- `baguette-worker.ts` owns the native process through an IPC lease. Owner loss must
  reap it and join pending host controls; never terminate the worker as normal cleanup. All build compositions emit
  the same sibling worker entry. No user simulator is shut down during cleanup.
- Keep Baguette version, artifact digest and executable digest pinned in the manifest;
  no PATH/Homebrew/upstream fallback. Use the runtime artifact channel with license
  notices; see [README](README.md).
- Patched Baguette builds use a distinct `-lody.N` runtime version/cache/key. Keep
  archive patch/toolchain provenance; never relabel patched bytes as upstream.
  Packaging: `scripts/package-baguette-runtime.mjs`.
- Local controls use trusted Machine RPC without Cloud I/O. Remote commands require
  exact signed preview-control proofs, including list/status and the ephemeral response
  key. Never put a viewer URL in workspace-readable Streams. Revocation fences proof
  verification as well as startup; owner/machine reassignment closes existing viewers.
  Browser and Simulator have independent service/proxy owners and share only transport
  primitives. No simulator sharing or anonymous viewer grant.
- One operation owns one native process and gateway, with lazy local and remote
  endpoints. Return only the requesting plane's URL/status, including while connecting.
  The remote gateway path selects remote flow budgets without reinitializing controls.
  Concurrent attachments coalesce; tunnel failure/retry leaves a local viewer running.
  Stop and remote revocation of an attached operation close both planes before release.
- Agent starts reserve/prepare but defer capture until the first
  authorized panel start/status. Agent reads never attach or renew; cancellation and
  idle expiry must settle that wait and release its lease. Agent ingress derives the
  active invocation user in the daemon; never accept an agent-supplied requester.
