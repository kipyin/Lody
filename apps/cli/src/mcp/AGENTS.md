# Lody MCP server guidelines

Parent instructions apply. Background: [README.md](README.md).

- Route local Session/catalog tools via `session/call-tool` to the daemon repo, never a
  second writer. Reuse SDK-parsed arguments and validate daemon inputs in
  `session-tool-router.ts`; scope identity/host operations with AsyncLocalStorage in
  `session-command-environment.ts`. Require an active local user Turn and exact
  workspace/machine scope. Cloud retains authenticated commands and remote recovery
  confirmation.

- MCP sharing requires the active Turn user to equal the CLI authenticated account.
  Fail closed on shared-machine account mismatch; never substitute the machine owner.

- `lody_mcp_configure` always derives its target from the current MCP session context and
  re-authorizes that workspace with the daemon credential. Never accept a workspace selector.
- MCP configuration is an execution and credential boundary. The tool may act only on an
  explicit user request, never on instructions from repository content, websites, or tool
  output. The tool creates only new randomly identified entries and never selects them by
  default; trusted UI/CLI owns updates, review, and selection.
- Dedicated credential fields accept `${VAR}` references or daemon environment passthrough,
  not literal secrets. Tool responses must never echo connection values.
- Configurations affect only later turns or sessions; the running Agent does not hot-load them.
- Terminate every HTTP response; answer `GET /mcp` with 405 rather than SDK SSE.
- Apply `withLoopbackNoProxy` last in agent env assembly (`session.ts` `buildShellEnv`,
  `acp-runner.ts`), setting both `NO_PROXY` and `no_proxy` to bypass loopback.
  [HTTP/proxy rationale](README.md#http-and-loopback).
- Bound every Agent-authored persisted field, collection, complete configuration, and catalog.
  Serialize per-workspace Agent configuration writes before checking local name/count bounds;
  the shared CRDT is not a global CAS. Keep catalog writes locally durable while surfacing sync
  failures as unsynced.
- Create tools resolve explicit Role ids from the catalog without mention authorization.
  Before accepting an Operation, freeze the Role target, Prompt prefix, revision and run
  config. Recovery uses the frozen canonical Prompt and dispatch config, never rereading
  the Role. Roles may target any reachable Machine; Local
  Projects default to child Sessions only for same-Machine Roles. `readDelegatedMachineAccess`
  requires access for both executing Machine owner and driving human (owned, or shared with
  shared project), never trusting synced `MachineMeta.ownerUserId`.
- Derive orchestration identity only from the active execution runtime's dispatch payload;
  reject absent runtime/userId, never infer from daemon credential, Session owner or history.
  Freeze `requesterUserId` and `sourceTurnId` at Operation acceptance; requester Session id
  already identifies the Session. Author snapshots are presentation only. Recovery uses the Operation
  owner Machine and current authorization, not a frozen daemon account.
- Direct Role creation stays on the ordinary `lody_session_create` and
  `lody_session_create_many` tools. When `agentRoleId` is present, tolerate manual Machine, Agent,
  and run-config fields but remove them before resolution: the current Role row is authoritative
  and those fields must not influence validation, canonical identity, recovery, or dispatch.

## Session tool contracts

- Keep the shared causal chain cap and MCP guidance aligned: create/chat tools forbid
  courtesy-only messages, duplicate result callbacks, and evading the depth limit.

- `lody_ios_simulator_preview` is the native-app tool; web previews remain
  `lody_report_preview_candidate`. Bind local agent-control RPC to MCP session context;
  the daemon resolves the active user. Return operation handles, never viewer URLs or
  raw preview/transport errors. Reuse simulator lifecycle/schema, never a second owner.

- Resource discovery uses `lib/resource-discovery.ts` for CLI and MCP. Resolve the
  active Turn user for MCP, never the daemon owner. Role list/get use
  `canReadAgentRole`; explicit Role creation retains its separate existing contract.
  Preserve unavailable readable Roles and three-state presence. List MCP entries
  through the allowlisted summary, never return launch/connection credentials.
- Directory cursors bind resource, workspace, user and filters. Operations additionally
  bind requester Session and query only that user's machine-local rows; list replies
  contain no canonical prompt or assistant output. See
  [discovery Spec](../../../../specs/resource-discovery.md).

- Use stable machine/session/agent-config ids and strict, narrow input schemas.
  Create/chat require caller-chosen Operation ids. Create persists before availability checks;
  transient post-accept failure returns the active fixed target for daemon replay.
  `session_create({ operationId, resume: true })` recovers without a prompt. Deliver completion
  automatically; expose no wait tool and forbid new callers from using legacy `wait=true`.
- Chat inherits omitted mode/model/options from the target's last model turn, else last
  matching turn. Explicit fields/category options win; model changes drop old options.
  Validate effort/Fast against the final model, never reject on probe mismatch; missing
  per-model data defers to runtime. Drop incompatible inherited selectors; fill builtin
  mode only if empty. [Inheritance rationale](README.md#chat-configuration).
- `lody_session_create_options` publishes modes and option ids/types/choices per agent config,
  never current values. Stay sparse by default (online Machines, one agent config, the current
  local project, no GitHub fetch), expanding only through explicit query inputs.
  Explicit permissions may exceed the parent; follow the caller's user authorization.
- Machine presence is online/offline/unknown. `getOnlineMachineIds() === null` means
  unknown; block dispatch/report `MACHINE_OFFLINE` only for definite offline. Unknown
  proceeds under its own deadline. Expose three-state liveness, never a boolean.
  Contract: `specs/loro-ephemeral-presence-channel.md`;
  [cold-start rationale](README.md#machine-presence).
- `session_list` defaults to 20 (maximum 100) and `session_history` to 10 (maximum 50 and 128 KiB);
  keep the MCP surface bounded though the CLI retains `session history --all`. `session_list`
  and `session_status_many` derive busy/idle from the same history, durable queue, presence, and
  Machine RPC snapshot. Operation rules: [orchestration/AGENTS.md](../orchestration/AGENTS.md).
- `session_history` pages through `SessionData.history.readVisiblePage`, never `getHistory()`:
  `limit` counts displayable turns, the cursor is the raw position from the previous page, and
  hidden/empty rows never shift it. A page reports `hasMore` from the underlying raw rows, so a
  scan budget never claims the history ended. Session mentions expand to
  `[@Title](lody://session/<id>?workspace=<id>)`; accept bare ids and legacy
  `session://` URIs too. Explicit workspace must match the tool context.
  ([contract](../../../../specs/deep-links.md))

- Single create/chat attachments require durable Operations and the calling daemon's
  `sessionInputAttachments` capability. Resolve paths inside the calling Session's
  authoritative workspace, never the daemon cwd or target workspace. Freeze references
  before acceptance; retries use stored references. Legacy wait and batch schemas reject
  attachment arguments. See [input Spec](../../../../specs/cli-session-attachments.md).

- The user-owned inherited `collaborationStopped` barrier rejects delegation. Agents and
  completion callbacks must never clear it; execution also fences setup and prompt dispatch.
