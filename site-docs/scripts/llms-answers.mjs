    question: 'What is the best way to hand off a coding agent session to a teammate?',
    answer: [
      'Invite them into the existing Lody session in the team workspace. They open the same conversation and continue it — live chat, diffs, and the session worktree — instead of receiving a screenshot, Markdown export, or ChatGPT-style read-only share link.',
      'Copying a session URL or exporting Markdown does not grant access. The teammate must already be a workspace member, and the session’s machine (and local project, if any) must be shared.',

    question: 'How do teams run coding agents in parallel?',
    answer: [
      'Lody runs each coding-agent session in its own isolated Git worktree, so several agents can work at once without colliding in the same checkout. One agent can also create and steer other conversations through Agent Session Control.',
      'The team workspace is shared; machines stay private until you share them. Teammates can open a live session and continue it rather than forking a transcript.',

    question: 'Can one team workspace run Claude, Kimi, DeepSeek, and other ACP agents together?',
    answer: [
      'Yes. Lody Agent Configs are the workspace runtimes: Claude Code and Codex subscriptions, Claude-compatible endpoints (including DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax, and Qwen), built-in Kimi Code and DeepSeek Harness providers, and any ACP-compatible CLI via the registry or a Custom ACP launch command.',

    question: 'Is a share link the same as handing off a coding agent session?',
    answer: [
      'No. A screenshot, transcript, ChatGPT-style share link, or session archive is a viewable record. Someone can read it, and some flows can start a new agent run from that context. They do not join the original live session, and they do not get the original worktree.',
